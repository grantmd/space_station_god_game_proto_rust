# Space Station God Game

[![Rust](https://github.com/grantmd/space_station_god_game_proto_rust/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/grantmd/space_station_god_game_proto_rust/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

This is a loose game/simulation idea I've had in my head for a while. I've tried to start it multiple times in various languages and engines, but now that I've found Rust and [ggez](https://ggez.rs/) this is the farthest I've gotten. I'm still continuing to learn Rust, and certainly open to suggestions of ways to improve what I'm doing here.
