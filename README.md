This is a loose game/simulation idea I've had in my head for a while. I've tried to start it multiple times in various languages and engines, but now that I've found Rust and [ggez](https://ggez.rs/) this is the farthest I've gotten. I'm still continuing to learn Rust, and certainly open to suggestions of ways to improve what I'm doing here.
